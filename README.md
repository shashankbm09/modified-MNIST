# Modified MNIST
## Abstract
The task at hand for this project was to build a deep learning model to perform an image analysis prediction
challenge on Modified MNIST dataset. Different models such as ResNet50, ResNet50 + Random Forest, ResNet50 + LSTM were
evaluated based on there accuracy metric. This project was also part of Kaggle Competition on which our teamâ€™s best accuracy
came out to 96.80%. This was achieved using a Resnet50 model.
